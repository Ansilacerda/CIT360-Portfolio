#Hibernate

These files show various implementations of the **Hibernate ORM**.  Hibernate is a class of Java methods etc that are used to connect to various RDBMS databases including Oracle, MySQL PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server.  If you use the Hibernate Query Language (HQL) to do the queries, you can insulate your code from major changes if you need to connect to a different database.
