#Sequence Diagram

I have been working to play catch up on my various code topics.
Trying to get my head around them sometimes is a challenge but a fun one (most of the time).
I have been working on client server sockets.  It's a very interesting topic.  I find that I like Java
more and more.

The first 2 files are a simple client server pair.

This next code creates a simple swing application that can work as either server (host) or client (guest).
