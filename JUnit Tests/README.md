# What is in the portfolio?

1.Create a portfolio on your personal gitHub repository including two types of sandbox code. The first type are code examples you received from a team member or that you downloaded from the web. Put these in projects in eclipse, get them to compile, run them, study them, and understand them. Do this for the 2 - 3 coding topics from the Topics and Resources your group assigned itself for this week.
 
2.The second type of sandbox code included in the portfolio is code you have written yourself based on what you learned from your team member's or internet sandbox code. Your code should include experiments in using the topics beyond what you found on the internet or were given by your team. These experiments should include using the topic code correctly and abusing it. This way you will know what to expect when your and other's code goes wrong. Treat the topic code badly!
 
3.The last items in the portfolio are links to some of your team's meetings. For each link include time-stamps that show you teaching your team mates, answering team mates questions, and asking questions of your own. These links and time stamps will be used to partially assess you for the professionalism portion of your final grade.

# Topics and Resources

### **What will I learn?**

In order to produce effective applications for mobile devices, strong knowledge, understanding, and ability are required in many areas. In order to achieve this, it is suggested that each student needs to know, understand, and be able to use the following tools and concepts in the fourteen topics listed here.

Resources will be used during the course. Topics will be assessed for fluency.

The Internet is a dynamic place. If one of the links is no longer available please email the instructor with a suggested URL to replace the inactive one.
